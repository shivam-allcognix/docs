## API Integration

For developers who want to integrate RAG Studio into their applications or AI agents.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Visit our [web interface](https://rag.allcognix.com) to create an account and generate your API key for programmatic access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Use our API to create a collection and organize your documents programmatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Upload documents via API and monitor processing status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate RAG Queries">
    Query your knowledge base from your applications and get intelligent responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Concepts for API Integration

**Collections**: Organize your documents into logical groups. Only one collection can be active at a time for uploads and queries.

**Document Processing**: Uploads are processed asynchronously. You'll receive a task ID to monitor progress.

**RAG Queries**: Ask natural language questions about your documents. RAG Studio finds relevant content and provides contextual answers.

**Cost Tracking**: Monitor your usage costs for embeddings and queries to stay within limits.

### Step 1: Create a Collection

Collections help you organize your documents. Think of them as folders that group related content together.

  See detailed API documentation for creating collections
</Card>

### Step 2: Upload Documents

Upload your documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.) to your collection. RAG Studio will automatically process and index them.

  See detailed API documentation for document uploads
</Card>

### Step 3: Monitor Processing

Document processing happens asynchronously. You can check the status of your uploads to ensure they're processed successfully.

  See detailed API documentation for task status monitoring
</Card>

### Step 4: Query Your Knowledge Base

Ask questions about your documents using natural language. RAG Studio will find relevant information and provide contextual answers.
