We offer multiple official models that are always available, consistently priced, and come with a stable API.

Official models work just like any other model on Omni Model Market, but they include several key advantages:

- Always on: These models stay warm and ready to respond instantly, so you never have to worry about cold starts.
- Stable API: Their input and output formats are fixed, ensuring you can integrate them without fearing breaking changes.
- Predictable pricing: Instead of being charged based on hardware or run time, official models use straightforward pricing metrics—such as number of images generated, video duration, or input/output tokens.
- Actively maintained: Omni Model Market manages these models directly with similar providers to ensure high quality and keeping them updated with the latest versions.


## API

Calling official models using Omni Model Market API key, you can opt for python or cURL language.

For example, here’s how you would run minimax/speech-02-hd in python. Notice that the model identifier includes only the owner and model name (minimax/speech-02-hd), with no version required:

```bash
url = "https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/v1/mmk-generate"
payload = {
    "model": "minimax/speech-02-hd",
    "text": "Voice cloning technology that offers voice synthesis."
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=120)
```
