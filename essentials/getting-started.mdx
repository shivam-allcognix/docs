Step-by-step guide to integrating RAG Studio into your applications

## Integration Overview

RAG Studio provides powerful APIs that make it easy to integrate intelligent document search and generation capabilities into your applications. This guide will walk you through the complete integration process.

## Prerequisites

Before you start integrating RAG Studio, ensure you have:

* **API Key**: Create your API key from the [website](https://modelmarket.allcognix.com)
* **HTTP Client**: Any HTTP client library (requests, fetch, axios, etc.)
* **Base URL**: `https://modelmarket.allcognix.com`

## Steps for integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication">
    Login to website, configure your API key and user identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Selection">
    Visit the explore page of website. Choose from text, vision, audio, video, or code-generation models for your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Call the API">
    Prepare the payload and hit the endpoint to get the expected result in formatted manner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle Responses">
    Process and use the results to integrate in your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor and Optimize">
    Track usage, costs, and performance from the dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Set Up Authentication

### API Key Configuration

Store your API key securely in environment variables:

```python  theme={null}
# Python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv('MODEL_MARKET_API_KEY')
URL = os.getenv('MODEL_MARKET_URL') or "https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/v1/mmk-generate"
```

### HTTP Client Setup

```python  theme={null}
# Python with requests
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

## Step 2: Model Selection

You can explore the full list of model on the explore page of the website: [modelmarket.allcognix.com/dashboard/explore](https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/explore):

## Step 3: Call the API

You can run any model on Omni Model Market from your Python code. Here’s an example that runs minimax/speech-02-hd to generate an audio from the text:

```python  theme={null}
def generate():
    payload = {
        "model": "minimax/speech-02-hd",
        "text": "Voice cloning technology that offers voice synthesis, emotional expression, and multilingual capabilities."
    }
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    response = requests.post(URL, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=120)
    output =
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        return result
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to create collection: {response.json()['detail']}")
```

## Step 4: Handling output

Process and use response results effectively. A typical successful response will look like this:

```python  theme={null}
{
  "output": {
    "type": "audio",
    "urls": [
      "https://replicate.delivery/xezq/TugNv7N1iZL7AVfEVm2OrUoX8fuOMfwTgi5spd..."
    ]
  },
  "cost": 0.0106,
  "service": "replicate",
  "status": "success",
  "created_at": "2025-11-24T11:13:16.948584Z",
  "generated_in": "2.5s"
}
```
Some models generate files as output, such as images or audio. These are returned in url fields, which you can easily save or process

```bash
import requests
file_url = result.get("output")["urls"][0]
with open("test.mp3", "wb") as f:
  f.write(file_url.content)
  print("Saved: test.mp3")
```

## Step 5: Monitor and Optimize
To keep your usage efficient and cost-effective, follow these best practices:

- Track Cost in Each Response: Every call returns a cost field. Store this in your logs or database to monitor usage patterns.
- Choose the Right Model: Some models are cheaper/faster alternatives. You can browse them on: [https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/explore](https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/explore)
- Handle Errors Gracefully: A few typical error reasons can be Invalid/missing API key, Timeout, Unsupported model parameters, Provider-side failure.

## Complete Integration Example

Here's a complete example that demonstrates all integration steps:

```python  theme={null}
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# Load environment variables

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("MODEL_MARKET_API_KEY")
URL = "https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/v1/mmk-generate"

headers = {
"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
"Content-Type": "application/json"
}

def generate_audio():
    payload = {"model": "minimax/speech-02-hd", "text": "Voice cloning technology that offers high-quality synthesis."}
    response = requests.post(URL, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=120)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    print("Status:", data["status"])
    print("Cost:", data["cost"])
    print("Provider:", data["service"])
    # Handle output (audio file)
    if data["output"]["type"] == "audio":
        audio_url = data["output"]["urls"][0]
        download_file(audio_url, "generated_audio.wav")
    return data

def download_file(url, filename):
  file_data = requests.get(url)
  with open(filename, "wb") as f:
    f.write(file_data.content)
    print(f"Saved file as {filename}")

if name == "main":
result = generate_audio()
print("Full result:", result)
```
