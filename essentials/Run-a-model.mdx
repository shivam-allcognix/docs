You can run models on Omni Model Market using the web application or the API.

## Run a model on the web

Each model on Omni Model Market includes its own playground page—a web-based interface where you can run the model. It’s the best place to experiment when you're testing a model for the first time. The playground shows all the model’s inputs visually and provides an interactive form that lets you execute the model directly in your browser.

Once you’ve tried out a model in the playground, you can easily run the model from your own code using the API.

## Run a model with the API

The web playground is perfect for exploring and understanding a model, but when you’re ready to use it in a real application—like a chatbot, website, or mobile app—you’ll need the API.

You can call our HTTP API from python or curl language, to make integration even easier. With this you can generate predictions in just a few lines of code.

cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/v1/mmk-generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "minimax/speech-02-hd",
        "input": "Voice cloning technology that offers voice synthesis"
      }'
```

Python
```bash
url = "https://modelmarket.allcognix.com/v1/mmk-generate"
payload = {
    "model": "minimax/speech-02-hd",
    "text": "Voice cloning technology that offers voice synthesis."
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=120)
```
