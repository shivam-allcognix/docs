## Welcome

Welcome to the Omni Model Market api reference documentation.
The guide allows you to help generate outputs (e.g., enhanced prompts, media, etc.) using a single unified generation endpoint.

### Our API is designed to be:

1. **Simple —** one endpoint handles all generation tasks
2. **Fast —** optimized inference pipeline
3. **Secure —** authenticated using API Keys
4. **Flexible —** supports multiple input types

## Authentication

> All requests to the API must include a valid API Key in the Authorization header.

Getting Your API Key
1. Create an account on our dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Click Create API Key
4. Copy and store it safely (shown only once)

<Warning> <b>Important:</b> API keys are <b>not stored in plain text</b>. You cannot view them again after creation. </Warning>

## API Key Management
<CardGroup cols={2}> <Card title="Store Securely" icon="shield"> Keep API keys in environment variables or a secrets manager. </Card> <Card title="Rotate Keys" icon="refresh"> Rotate keys regularly to reduce security risks. </Card> <Card title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock"> Always call the API using HTTPS to protect your key during transit. </Card> <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line"> Check your dashboard for API usage spikes or unusual patterns. </Card> <Card title="Revoke an API key" icon="chart-line"> You can also delete/revoke your api key from the dashboard when it is compromised, no longer needed, or has incorrect permissions to prevent unauthorized access to your services and data </Card> </CardGroup>
