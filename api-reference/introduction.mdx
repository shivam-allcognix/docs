## Welcome

Welcome to the Omni Model Market api reference documentation.
The guide allows you to help generate outputs (e.g., enhanced prompts, media, etc.) using a single unified generation endpoint.

### Our API is designed to be:

1. **Simple —** one endpoint handles all generation tasks
2. **Fast —** optimized inference pipeline
3. **Secure —** authenticated using API Keys
4. **Flexible —** supports multiple input types

## Authentication

> All requests to the API must include a valid API Key in the Authorization header.

Getting Your API Key
1. Create an account on our dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Click Create API Key
4. Copy and store it safely (shown only once)

<Warning> <b>Important:</b> API keys are <b>not stored in plain text</b>. You cannot view them again after creation. </Warning>
